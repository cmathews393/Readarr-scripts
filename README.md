Collection of a few different scripts to manage Readarr and fill some gaps in Readarr's default functionality, especially around searching and tags. 
Also interfaces with audiobookshelf on some functions to add tags based on readarr tags. 

For example, my use case is importing books into readarr for a couple user based on Goodreads lists. I tag them with the users name, and now with this script, I can tag them in audiobookshelf for easier searching. 
Helpful for large libraries, but also forces a search on missing items, filtered by tag instead of having to go to them one by one.
